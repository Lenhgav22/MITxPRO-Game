# Final_Project
 Game-breaking Bugs:
 1. Boxes can sometimes clip through the ground when they get too close to under the terrain collider. Keep boxes above ground if possible and drop them onto pressure plates.
 2. Boxes when grabbed improperly can sometimes prevent the crane from moving or even moving it autonomously.
 General Bugs:
 1. The player and crane will sometimes clip on terrain on the sides of the map running to the side and back to where you want to go will prevent this.
 2. The game finish screen will still show up on restart the game. Just press restart again and it will disappear.
 General Information:
 I'm currently unable to make new iterations or work on the game due to medical reasons. One thing I neglected to include is the text that tells you escape opens the settings. I could institute this in later iterations but I am unable to currently.
 Thank you so much for playing my game and instructing this amazing course! I hope you enjoy!
